# Development

Building, running and releasing Thesio. Conventions are in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md); the architecture is in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Build

Requires Go 1.27 or later, a Rust toolchain (`typst/rust-toolchain.toml` pins the version), and on macOS the Xcode command line tools for cgo.

```sh
scripts/build-typst.sh            # the Typst library, once and after changes to typst/
CGO_ENABLED=1 go run .            # the app on ~/Documents/Thesio
CGO_ENABLED=1 go tool mygo dev    # with live reload
CGO_ENABLED=1 go tool mygo build  # Thesio.app and a disk image in build/
```

With [just](https://github.com/casey/just): `just start`, `just bundle`, `just check`.

The default vault is `~/Documents/Thesio`. Set `THESIO_HOME` to use another folder, as in `THESIO_HOME=$(mktemp -d) go run .`; `testdata/sample-vault` is a small vault to try.

`scripts/build-typst.sh` builds the library for this machine. For a universal macOS app, build both architectures first. Set the deployment target to `macos.minimumSystemVersion` from `mygo.json`, or the app needs the macOS it was built on whatever its Info.plist says; `just bundle` and the release workflow do this, and `scripts/check-macos-target.sh` checks a built app:

```sh
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=$(plutil -extract macos.minimumSystemVersion raw mygo.json)
export CGO_CFLAGS="-O2 -g -mmacosx-version-min=$MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET"
scripts/build-typst.sh aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin
CGO_ENABLED=1 go tool mygo build -platform darwin/universal
```

## Release

Pushing a tag `vX.Y.Z` runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`. It builds the universal macOS app, Linux x64 and arm64, and Windows x64, each on its own runner, and uploads them with signed updates to a draft release of the tag.

1. Set `version` in `mygo.json` to `X.Y.Z`. The workflow fails when the tag does not match it.
2. Move the `Unreleased` entries of `CHANGELOG.md` under `## X.Y.Z`. The update window shows that section.
3. Commit, then tag and push: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
4. Review the draft release on GitHub and publish it. Installed apps then update to it.

The repository needs the secret `MYGO_UPDATER_PRIVATE_KEY`, the private key matching `updates.publicKey` in `mygo.json`:

```sh
gh secret set MYGO_UPDATER_PRIVATE_KEY < ~/Library/Application\ Support/mygo/update-keys/mygo-update.key
```

The macOS app is signed with the Developer ID in `mygo.json` and notarized with an App Store Connect API key (App Store Connect → Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API → Team Keys). The workflow needs these secrets: `MACOS_CERTIFICATE` (the "Developer ID Application" certificate with its key, exported from Keychain Access as a `.p12`, base64-encoded), `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_API_KEY` (the `.p8`, base64-encoded), `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` and `APPLE_API_ISSUER`:

```sh
base64 -i certificate.p12 | gh secret set MACOS_CERTIFICATE
gh secret set MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD
base64 -i AuthKey_KEYID.p8 | gh secret set APPLE_API_KEY
gh secret set APPLE_API_KEY_ID
gh secret set APPLE_API_ISSUER
```

A local `go tool mygo build` signs with the same identity and notarizes with the keychain profile `notary`: create it once with `xcrun notarytool store-credentials notary --key AuthKey_KEYID.p8 --key-id KEYID --issuer ISSUER`, or pass `-skip-notarize`. Windows builds are unsigned; SmartScreen warns about the installer. To sign them, add `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE` and `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, enable the commented step in the workflow and set `windows.certificate` in `mygo.json` as [MyGo's guide](https://github.com/egoist/mygo/blob/main/docs/github-actions.md) describes.
